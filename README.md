# Oh No! (C Program)

** warning: this program may cause existential dread, spontaneous laughter, or uncontrollable eye-rolling **

Ever felt like the universe is conspiring against you? Like the stars are aligning in a way that's just a little too ominous? Well, buckle up, friend, because this program is about to take it to the next level.

**What is this sorcery?**

This is a simple C program that prints "Oh No!" to the console. But don't be fooled - it's not just any ordinary "Oh No!". This is a deeply philosophical and existential "Oh 
No!" that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality.

**But wait, there's more!**

* It's also a great way to annoy your friends and family with an endless loop of "Oh No!"s.
* It's a perfect conversation starter at parties (just don't say we didn't warn you).
* It's a great way to test your computer's speakers (because who doesn't love a good "Oh No!" blast).

**How to summon the existential dread (and laughter)**

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang).

2. **Clone the repository:**

And behold, the existential dread (and laughter):
``` Oh No!  ```
